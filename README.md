# CppConfigManager
Impementation of a Config parser for C++ Applications using xerces-c Library Implementation.

Tried ideally building a shared library .so for this config manager. but there seem to be problems with xerces-c library relocation issues.
tried solving it with some attempts at rebuild but did not succeed. Will ask on fedora forum for the same if somebody has solved the issue.
Tried the latest xerces-c 3.2.1 but no success as of now.
